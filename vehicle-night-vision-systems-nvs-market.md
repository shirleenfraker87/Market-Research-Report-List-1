<p><strong>The Vehicle Night Vision Systems (NVS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Near-Infrared Ray</li><li>Far Infrared Ray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle Night Vision Systems (NVS) enhance visibility in low-light conditions using two primary technologies: Near-Infrared (NIR) and Far-Infrared (FIR). NIR systems emit infrared light, reflecting off objects to create a detailed image, ideal for short to medium-range detection. FIR systems, also known as thermal imaging, detect heat emitted by objects, providing clear visuals in complete darkness or adverse weather, suitable for long-range detection. Both technologies improve driver safety by identifying pedestrians, animals, or obstacles beyond standard headlight range.</p></p>
