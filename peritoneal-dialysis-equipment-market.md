<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peritoneal Dialysis Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Automated Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Peritoneal Dialysis Equipment market primarily comprises two types: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD). CAPD is a manual process that allows patients to perform dialysis independently throughout the day, using gravity to facilitate fluid exchange. In contrast, APD employs a machine to automate the dialysis process, often performed overnight, enhancing convenience and efficiency. Both methods aim to provide renal replacement therapy, offering flexibility and improved quality of life for patients with chronic kidney disease.</p></p>
