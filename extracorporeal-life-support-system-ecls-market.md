<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial)</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) refers to advanced medical technology that temporarily supports patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure. The market is primarily segmented into two types: Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV). VA ECLS provides both cardiac and respiratory support by circulating blood from a vein to an artery, useful in heart failure cases. Conversely, VV ECLS primarily addresses respiratory issues, facilitating oxygenation by routing blood between veins without heart support, making it ideal for patients with severe lung conditions.</p></p>
