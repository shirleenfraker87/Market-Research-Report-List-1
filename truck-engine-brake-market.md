<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck engine brake market primarily includes two types: compression release brakes and exhaust brakes. Compression release brakes, often known as "Jake brakes," utilize the engine's compression cycle to slow down the vehicle, enhancing braking power without relying on traditional friction brakes. In contrast, exhaust brakes work by restricting the exhaust flow, creating back pressure that slows the engine and, consequently, the vehicle. Both systems improve vehicle control, reduce brake wear, and enhance safety, particularly in heavy-duty applications.</p></p>
