<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflective Materials for Clothing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Beads</li><li>Microprismatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflective materials for clothing encompass two main market types: glass beads and microprismatic materials. Glass beads are tiny, spherical structures that reflect light effectively, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions; they are often applied in a coating to fabrics. Microprismatic materials, on the other hand, use a series of tiny prisms to reflect light in a more efficient manner, providing brighter visibility at wider angles. Both types improve safety for wearers, particularly in workwear and sport apparel, by increasing nighttime visibility.</p></p>
