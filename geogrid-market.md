<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial</li><li>Biaxial</li><li>Triaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geogrids are geosynthetic materials used to reinforce soil and improve load distribution in civil engineering. The market for geogrids is categorized into three types: uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial. Uniaxial geogrids primarily enhance vertical load capacity, ideal for retaining walls and slopes. Biaxial geogrids provide strength in two directions, widely used for road and parking lot stabilization. Triaxial geogrids offer tridimensional support, effectively distributing loads over a larger area, making them suitable for various applications in infrastructure and road construction.</p></p>
