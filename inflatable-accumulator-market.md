<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inflatable Accumulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>Spring-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inflatable accumulator market is primarily divided into two types: gravity and spring-type accumulators. Gravity accumulators utilize the weight of a fluid column for pressure regulation, making them ideal for applications where consistent, low-pressure fluid flow is needed. On the other hand, spring-type accumulators use stored mechanical energy from a compressed spring to maintain pressure. This type is suitable for applications requiring rapid response and high-pressure storage, providing versatility across various industrial and hydraulic systems.</p></p>
