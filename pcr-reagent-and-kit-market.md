<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCR Reagent and Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Built-in Hot Start</li><li>No built-in Hot Start</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCR reagent and kit market is divided into two main types: built-in hot start and no built-in hot start. Built-in hot start reagents enhance specificity by activating polymerases only at elevated temperatures, minimizing non-specific amplification during the initial heating phase. Conversely, no built-in hot start reagents allow polymerases to be active at lower temperatures, which can lead to unwanted amplification but may be more cost-effective. Each type serves different experimental needs and preferences in molecular biology research.</p></p>
