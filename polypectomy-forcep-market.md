<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypectomy Forcep Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot</li><li>Cold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polypectomy forceps are specialized tools used in medical procedures to remove polyps from the gastrointestinal tract. The market for these devices is categorized into hot and cold types. Hot forceps utilize electrosurgical techniques to cut and coagulate tissue simultaneously, reducing bleeding during polyp removal. In contrast, cold forceps rely on mechanical means for excision without thermal effects, making them suitable for specific cases where thermal injury must be avoided. Both types cater to distinct clinical needs and practitioner preferences.</p></p>
