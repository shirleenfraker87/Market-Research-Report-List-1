<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impedance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Expansion</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Impedance Muffler market consists of two main types: Expansion Type and Resonance Type. </p><p>Expansion Type mufflers reduce noise by allowing exhaust gases to expand within a larger chamber, dissipating sound energy. They are typically simpler in design and effective at lower frequencies. </p><p>Resonance Type mufflers, in contrast, use carefully tuned chambers to create sound waves that cancel out specific frequencies, providing more control over noise reduction. Both types are essential for meeting regulatory standards and enhancing vehicle performance.</p></p>
